Click on a column header to sort by that column. (The third column has sorting disabled.)
      To demonstrate the live sorting we provide a button that toggles the gender of Alexander Foley.
      Sort by gender (ASC - so click twice) then name (using shift click), so that Alexander is at the top of the grid,
      then click the toggleGender button.

<br>
<button id="toggleGender" ng-click="toggleGender()" class="btn btn-success">Toggle Gender</button>
<div id="grid1" ui-grid="gridOptions1"></div>

      You can set an initial sort state for the grid by defining the `sort` property on your column definitions.
      The `direction` sub-property says which way to sort, and the `priority` says what order to sort the columns
      in (lower priority gets sorted first).
